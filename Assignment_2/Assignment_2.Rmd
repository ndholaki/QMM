## Let's construct the WGC issue. Notably, there were three constraints and two decision variables.
##In the first formulation, the objective function and constraints would be constructed immediately.
```{r}
# make an lp object with 0 constraints and 9 decision variables
lprec <- make.lp(nrow=0, ncol=9)
set.objfn(lprec, c(420, 360, 300, 420, 360, 300, 420, 360, 300))
lp.control(lprec,sense='max')
add.constraint(lprec, c(1, 1, 1,0,0,0,0,0,0), "<=", 750)
add.constraint(lprec, c(0,0,0,1, 1, 1,0,0,0), "<=", 900)
add.constraint(lprec, c(0,0,0,0,0,0,1, 1, 1), "<=", 450)
add.constraint(lprec, c(20,15,12,0,0,0,0,0,0), "<=", 13000)
add.constraint(lprec, c(0,0,0,20,15,12,0, 0, 0), "<=", 12000)
add.constraint(lprec, c(0,0,0,0,0,0,20, 15, 12), "<=", 5000)
add.constraint(lprec, c(1,0,0,1,0,0,1, 0, 0), "<=", 900)
add.constraint(lprec, c(0,1,0,0,1,0,0, 1, 0), "<=", 1200)
add.constraint(lprec, c(0,0,1,0,0,1,0, 0, 1), "<=", 750)
set.bounds(lprec, lower = c(0, 0), columns = c(1, 9)) #Not really needed
RowNames <- c("Cap1", "cap2", "cap3", "space1","space2","space3", "sale1","sale2","sale3")
ColNames <- c("L1", "M1","S1","L2", "M2","S2","L3", "M3","S3")
dimnames(lprec) <- list(RowNames, ColNames)
# Now, print out the model
lprec
write.lp(lprec,filename = "Assignment_2",type = "lp")
solve(lprec)
get.objective(lprec)
get.variables(lprec)
```

##We now solve the above LP problem
```{r}
solve(lprec)
```

##The output above doesn't indicate that the answer is 0, but that there was a successful solution.
##We now output the value of the objective function, and the variables.
```{r}
get.objective(lprec)
get.variables(lprec)
get.constraints(lprec)
```
