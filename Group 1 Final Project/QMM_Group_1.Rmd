```
```{r}

```
Here 0 indicates that it is possible to formulate the model and find solution. In this problem it means that we can allocate Students into 4 different groups by satifying both objective function and constraints.
```{r}
get.objective(group_project)
```
It is the maximum value of objective function considering the constraints.

```{r}
get.variables(group_project)
```
Following are the groups to be formed to maximize the chance of success for each group based on above results:
\newline
Group 1 - 6,10,11
\newline
Group 2 - 4,7,12
\newline
Group 3 - 3,5,9
\newline
Group 4 - 1,2,8
